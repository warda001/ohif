# 🔧 NETLIFY FINAL FIX - Deploy Directory Issue

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

From the error logs, I can see that:
1. Netlify is cloning from: `kinkajoucodez/ohif` (not your `warda001/ohif` repo)
2. The publish directory is set to `/opt/build/repo/dist` (not `/opt/build/repo/platform/app/dist`)
3. This suggests the netlify.toml configuration is being overridden

## ✅ **SOLUTION: Create New Netlify Site**

Since there's configuration confusion, create a fresh Netlify deployment:

### **Steps:**

1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Click**: "New site from Git"
3. **Connect**: GitHub
4. **Select**: `warda001/ohif` (YOUR repository)
5. **Configure** (IMPORTANT - set these exactly):
   ```
   Base directory: platform/app
   Build command: yarn install && yarn build:viewer:ci  
   Publish directory: dist
   ```
6. **Click**: "Deploy site"

### **Alternative: Fix Current Site**

If you want to fix your current site (`wardaohif.netlify.app`):

1. **Go to**: Netlify Dashboard → Your Site → Site Settings
2. **Click**: Build & Deploy → Continuous Deployment
3. **Update** Repository to: `warda001/ohif` (if it shows wrong repo)
4. **Set**:
   - **Base directory**: `platform/app`
   - **Build command**: `yarn install && yarn build:viewer:ci`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
5. **Clear** cache: Deploys → Options → Clear Cache and Deploy Site

## 🎯 **Why This Will Work**

The local build proved that:
- ✅ The build command works perfectly
- ✅ Creates 206MB of assets in `dist/` directory
- ✅ Includes all necessary files: `index.html`, `_redirects`, etc.
- ✅ Your DICOM dataset integration is working

**The issue is just configuration - once Netlify uses the right settings, it will work!**

## 🚀 **Expected Result**

After the correct deployment:
- 🏥 Professional OHIF Medical Imaging Viewer
- 📊 Your DICOM dataset `daae3df7f522b56724aed7e3e544c0fe` integrated
- 🌐 Working URL (like `https://amazing-name.netlify.app`)
- 📱 Mobile-responsive medical imaging interface

**Try creating a NEW Netlify site - that's the safest approach! 🎉**
