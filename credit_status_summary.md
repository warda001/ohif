# Credit System Analysis Summary

## Current Status: **NO CREDIT SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED**

Based on my analysis of your codebase, here are the findings regarding credits:

### What I Found:

1. **Billing System**: 
   - ✅ A basic billing system exists in `backend/src/routes/billing.js`
   - ✅ Database table for billing records (`billing` table)
   - ✅ Tracks invoices, amounts due/paid, billing periods
   - ⚠️ But this is for invoicing organizations, not individual user credits

2. **Database Schema**:
   - Organizations table: No credit/balance fields
   - Users table: No credit/balance fields  
   - Billing table: Tracks organizational billing, not user credits

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - No credit-related environment variables
   - Standard configuration for database, JWT, email, etc.

4. **Search Results**:
   - Only credit mention found was "$5 credits/month" for Railway hosting in deployment guide
   - No API endpoints for checking user credits
   - No credit balance tracking in the database
   - No quota or usage limit system implemented

### Conclusion:

**You do NOT have a credit system implemented in this codebase.** This appears to be a radiology platform with:
- User management (organizations, users, roles)
- Medical imaging functionality (DICOM handling)  
- Basic billing for organizations
- But no individual user credit tracking

### If You Need Credits:

To implement a credit system, you would need to:
1. Add credit balance fields to users or organizations table
2. Create credit transaction tracking
3. Add API endpoints for credit management
4. Implement credit deduction logic for platform usage

The current billing system only handles organizational invoicing, not per-user credit consumption.
