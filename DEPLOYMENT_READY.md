## 🚀 **Deployment Steps for Netlify**

### **Method 1: Git Push (Recommended)**

1. **Commit & Push the files**:
   ```bash
   git add netlify.toml platform/app/dist
   git commit -m "Add netlify.toml and fresh build output"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **In Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Go to **Deploys** tab
   - Wait for auto-deploy to complete
   - Your site will be live at: `https://wardaohif.netlify.app`

### **Method 2: Manual Deploy (If Git fails)**

1. **Download deployment package**: 
   - File: `platform/app/ohif-deploy.tar.gz` (52MB)
   - Extract this file to get all build assets

2. **Netlify Drag & Drop**:
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Scroll to "Need to deploy manually?"
   - Drag the **extracted contents** (not the .tar.gz file)

## 🧪 **Testing Your Deployment**

### **Basic Tests**:
1. **Open**: `https://wardaohif.netlify.app`
2. **Check**: Does the OHIF interface load?
3. **Console**: Press F12 → Console (should be no major errors)

### **DICOM Dataset Tests**:
Your viewer is pre-configured with dataset ID `daae3df7f522b56724aed7e3e544c0fe`:

1. **Auto-load test**: Dataset should load automatically
2. **Manual load**: Try File → Open Local Files
3. **DICOMweb test**: Should connect to DICOM Library
