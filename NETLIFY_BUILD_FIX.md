# ✅ NETLIFY BUILD FIX APPLIED

## 🐛 **Problem**: 
Netlify was getting error: `Command "build:viewer:ci" not found`

## 🔧 **Root Cause**: 
Netlify was trying to run the build command from the wrong directory (project root instead of `platform/app`)

## ✅ **Fix Applied**:
Updated `netlify.toml` with correct configuration:

```toml
[build]
  base = "platform/app"                    # ← Set working directory
  command = "yarn install && yarn build:viewer:ci"  # ← Run from platform/app
  publish = "dist"                         # ← Relative to base directory
```

**Before**: Netlify tried to run from project root → ❌ `build:viewer:ci` not found
**After**: Netlify runs from `platform/app` → ✅ `build:viewer:ci` exists in package.json

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Option 1: Your Current Netlify Site**
If you're using your existing Netlify site (`wardaohif.netlify.app`):
1. **Go to**: Netlify Dashboard → Your Site → Deploys
2. **Click**: "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
3. **Wait**: 3-5 minutes for build to complete
4. **Test**: Visit your URL

### **Option 2: Create New Netlify Site (Recommended)**
1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Click**: "New site from Git"
3. **Select**: `warda001/ohif` repository
4. **Settings**: Leave everything default (netlify.toml will handle it)
5. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy site"

## 📋 **Expected Build Process**

With the fix, Netlify will:
1. ✅ Set working directory to `platform/app`
2. ✅ Run `yarn install` (install dependencies)
3. ✅ Run `yarn build:viewer:ci` (build the OHIF viewer)
4. ✅ Publish the `dist` folder contents
5. ✅ Your DICOM viewer will be live!

## 🎯 **Result**

You'll get a working OHIF Medical Imaging Viewer with:
- 🏥 Professional DICOM viewer interface
- 📊 Your dataset `daae3df7f522b56724aed7e3e544c0fe` integrated
- 🌐 Live URL you can share
- 📱 Mobile-responsive design

**The build should now succeed! 🎉**
