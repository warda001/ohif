# 🔧 Netlify Deployment Fix - cornerstone-wado-image-loader Version Issue

## ✅ Problem Identified and Fixed

The Netlify deployment was failing because of an incorrect package version reference:

**Error**: `error Couldn't find any versions for "cornerstone-wado-image-loader" that matches "^4.13.3"`

**Root Cause**: Version `4.13.3` doesn't exist on npm. The latest available version is `4.13.2`.

---

## 🛠️ Fix Applied

I have already fixed the issue by updating the problematic package.json file:

**File**: `ohif/extensions/dicom-library-datasource/package.json`
**Change**: Updated `cornerstone-wado-image-loader` version from `^4.13.3` to `^4.13.2`

```diff
"dependencies": {
  "dicom-parser": "^1.8.13",
- "cornerstone-wado-image-loader": "^4.13.3"
+ "cornerstone-wado-image-loader": "^4.13.2"
}
```

The yarn.lock file has also been updated automatically to reflect this change.

## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### Option 1: Manual Git Commit (Recommended)
Since I couldn't push to your repository due to permissions, you need to commit and push these changes:

```bash
cd ohif
git add extensions/dicom-library-datasource/package.json yarn.lock
git commit -m "Fix cornerstone-wado-image-loader version from 4.13.3 to 4.13.2"
git push origin master
```

### Option 2: Re-deploy on Netlify
Once you push the changes, trigger a new deployment on Netlify. The build should now succeed.

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment Method
If you prefer a different deployment approach, the locally built files are ready in `platform/app/dist/` (206MB).

## 🔍 Verification

After deployment, you can verify the fix worked by:

1. ✅ No yarn installation errors in Netlify build logs
2. ✅ DICOM dataset loads with ID: `daae3df7f522b56724aed7e3e544c0fe`
3. ✅ OHIF viewer displays properly

## 📊 Summary

- **Status**: ✅ FIXED (locally)
- **Action Required**: Push the changes to Git
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `ohif/extensions/dicom-library-datasource/package.json`
  - `ohif/yarn.lock`
