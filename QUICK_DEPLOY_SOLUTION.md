## Current Status: 404 Error Persisting

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Solution 1: Manual Drag & Drop Deploy (2 minutes)**

1. **Download the build files**:
   - Go to your workspace: `platform/app/dist/`
   - Select ALL files in the dist folder
   - Create a ZIP file with all contents

2. **Manual Deploy**:
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
   - Drag and drop the ZIP file or the entire `dist` folder
   - Get instant URL (like: `https://random-name.netlify.app`)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Solution 2: Vercel Deploy (1 minute)**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy from dist folder
cd platform/app/dist
vercel --prod
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Solution 3: GitHub Pages (Free)**

# Create gh-pages branch
git checkout -b gh-pages
git rm -rf .
cp -r platform/app/dist/* .
git add .

git push origin gh-pages
```

   - Deploys â†’ Options â†’ Clear Cache and Deploy Site

## ðŸš€ **Recommended: Try Vercel First**

npx vercel --prod
```

## ðŸ”§ **Debug Current Issue**

The problem might be:
